Description:

This plugin was forked off from the OpenGL-enabled vdr-plugin-softhddevice (which is a fork of the original one itself :) ),
in order to prepare developing a generic OpenGL Osd plugin usable on various platforms VDR runs on, independently of the
output (device) plugin, from PCs to different SoCs, as suggested in the discussions at
http://www.vdr-portal.de/board16-video-disk-recorder/board55-vdr-plugins/p1271861-softhddevice-mit-high-level-osd/#post1271861
