This is a PSL ("Plugin Shared Library") for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR).

Initially written by Louis Braun <louis DOT braun AT gmx DOT de> as an extension to the
vdr-plugin-softhddevice, extended by Andreas Baierl <ichgeh AT imkreisrum DOT de> for GLES2,
this code was forked by Lucian Muresan <lucianm AT users DOT sourceforge DOT net> and converted
to a PSL.

Description:

This PSL was forked off from the OpenGL-enabled vdr-plugin-softhddevice (which is a fork of the original one itself :) ),
in order to consolidate the generic code needed for an OpenGL Osd usable on various platforms VDR runs on, independently of the
output (device) plugin, from PCs to different SoCs, as suggested in the discussions (sorry, only in German) at
http://www.vdr-portal.de/board16-video-disk-recorder/board55-vdr-plugins/p1271861-softhddevice-mit-high-level-osd/#post1271861
and
